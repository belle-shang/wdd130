        <p>Hello! My name is Belle Shang and I am from Taiwan. I enjoy reading novels, singing Christmas songs, hiking on mountains, serving others and staying with family. I am teaching electronics in high school which is really fun for me to see students creating circuits and debugging codes. My plan is to slach a full-stack enginner in the future.</p>
